# Notification Channels

Hookflo allows you to route webhook events to different notification channels. This enables you to receive notifications in the way that works best for your team and workflow.

## Available Channels

Hookflo currently supports the following notification channels:

### Communication Channels

- [Email](/channels/email) - Receive webhook notifications via email
- [Slack](/channels/slack) - Get webhook notifications in your Slack channels

## Channel Features

All Hookflo notification channels include:

- **Event Filtering**: Specify which events should be sent to each channel
- **Customizable Formatting**: Control how notifications appear in each channel
- **Delivery Scheduling**: Choose when to receive notifications (immediate, digest, or scheduled)
- **Failure Handling**: Automatic retries ensure notifications are delivered

## Coming Soon

We're constantly adding new notification channels. Here are some channels we're working on:

- Microsoft Teams
- Discord
- SMS (via Twilio)
- Push Notifications

Don't see a channel you need? [Contact us](mailto:support@hookflo.dev) to request a new notification channel.

## Channel Configuration

Each notification channel can be configured independently. You can set up multiple instances of the same channel type with different configurations. For example, you might want to:

- Send critical alerts to one Slack channel and informational updates to another
- Email certain team members about specific events
- Create digests for routine updates while sending immediate notifications for urgent events

See the individual channel documentation for specific configuration options.
